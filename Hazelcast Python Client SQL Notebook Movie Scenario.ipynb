    "# Hazelcast Python Client SQL Support Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the SQL support of Hazelcast Python Client. Hazelcast provides in-depth SQL support for Map data structures kept in Hazelcast Clusters. Using Hazelcast SQL support, you can create mappings between your data and a database table and execute SQL queries on the Map. This support provides fast in-memory computing using SQL without writing complex functions that iterate through your maps.</br></br>\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you can either use your local cluster or Hazelcast Cloud. We will use Hazelcast Cloud as our cluster provider to not worry about setup or installation. Hazelcast Cloud offers free registration with a 200MB storage area. You can register using the following link and create a cluster in a few minutes: https://cloud.hazelcast.com/. </br></br> Remember that you can run this notebook in a Google Colabrotary environment without dealing with local installations. If you have any issues, you can ask your questions in Hazelcast Community channels, find links here: https://hazelcast.com/dev-community/ "

We have some filters to select movies among 4K entries, like `vote_count`, `vote_average`, and `release_date`. You can use `AS` keyword to specify the column name of result. Without Hazelcast, typically, we need to iterate over our map and check whether the current entry fits into our definition or not. Also, this approach requires an additional structure to store our selected entries. With the inclusive SQL support of Hazelcast, we can translate our filters to a SQL query and execute it on our map.
