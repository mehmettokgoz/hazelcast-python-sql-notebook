    "# Hazelcast Python Client SQL Support Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows example usage of Hazelcast Python Client using SQL functions. Hazelcast provides in-depth SQL support for your data kept in Hazelcast clusters. You can create a mapping between a database table and your data resource and execute SQL queries on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify setup, this tutorial uses Hazelcast Cloud for the cluster service. Hazelcast Cloud offers free registration with 200MB storage area. You can register the Hazelcast Cloud using following link and create a cluster in few minutes: https://cloud.hazelcast.com/. You can follow this tutorial to create a cluster in Cloud. If you have any issue, you can ask your questions in Hazelcast Community Slack channel. "
